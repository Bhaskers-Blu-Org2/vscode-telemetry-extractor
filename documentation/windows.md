# Windows
The setup for windows is a little different as it does not contain many of the unix commands necessary to execute many of the commands.

*The steps are as follows*
1. Ensure you have VS Code 1.35 or greater installed
2. Insall [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and select Linux containers upon installation
2. Install the remote extension pack found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
3. In the bottom right hand corner click the >< symbol in green and click open folder in container. Note this will take some time


The integrated terminal will now be connected to the docker and you may execute the program as normal.

Another option is to utilize WSL in which case you can follow the steps outlined in [README.md](../README.md)
